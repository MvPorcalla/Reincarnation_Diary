Can you help me design a LocalStorage-based account system for my text-based game (similar to Life in Adventure)?
The game does not need mid-game save/load, but I want to:

Track persistent player account progress across multiple runs:
âœ… Achievements
âœ… Total points
âœ… Player level
âœ… Unlocked classes
âœ… Best character records
Automatically save progress at the end of each story.
Provide export/import functionality to protect against browser data loss.
Ensure this system will also work when I convert the game to an Electron standalone app.

ðŸ“Œ Please provide:
Recommended LocalStorage structure for scalable account data.
A modular file setup (preferably using saveManager.js).
Example save, load, export, and import functions.
Best practices for account-based progression using LocalStorage.
